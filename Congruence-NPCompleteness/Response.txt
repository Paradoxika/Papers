Dear editors and reviewers,

We thank you for your positive evaluation of our paper.

Below is a list of changes made to address the reviewers' comments.


============================

Reviewer #1: 


> Abstract: we provide here an NP-hardness proof --> by reading the abstract
>          one could understand that the paper does not prove the problem
>          to be in NP. I would replace hardness by completeness.

Done.


> Page 2, line 45: polynomial time algorithm --> polynomial-time algorithm

Fixed.

> Page 3, line 2: this short paper --> this paper

Done.


> Page 5: when explaining the congruence graph, I would add a small
>        example with a figure including the resulting congruence graph


TODO  Pascal: f(f(f(a))) = f(f(f(f(f(a))))) and f(f(a)) = a ==> f(a) = a


> Page 5, line 46: as far as I know, explanation production can only be
>        done in time O(k \alpha(k,k)) for a proof with k literals.

TODO

Pascal: This refers to "the explanation production is linear with respect to the
explanation size,"
We are considering the full size, not only the number of literals, so I believe we are on the safe side.  It seems strange the an explanation production does not depend at all on the size of the terms.

TODO

Pascal: What about "Valuations"

> Page 9, line 19: cardinality constraint on the explanation -->
>                 cardinality constraint on the explanation size

Done.

TODO


> Page 10, line 36: Roberto Nieuwenhuis --> Robert Nieuwenhuis

Fixed.


> Page 11, line 5: Jovanovi --> Jovanovic

Fixed.

Fixed.

> p 2: 'searching for short paths' => did you mean shortest paths ? 

TODO

> p 4: Def 2: is 'compatible' a standard term ? I always saw 'congruent'. 

TODO


> "(identity of two terms can be checked in

We use the usual terminology of firtst-order logic. A term is either 
a constant/variable symbol or an n-ary function symbol applied to n terms. 
Therefore, a function symbol is generally not a term, except in the 
case of nullary function symbols (i.e. constants). 

TODO: Maybe we should add this to the preliminary section?

TODO


> p 8: The bottom dotted edge on the left is wrong? (t1(x3) --- t1(\bot_3))

TODO

> Please use \qed at the end of proofs. 

PF: Fixed

==========================

Reviewer #3: 


> p3, 2: "short paper" -> "short article"

Fixed to "article". Reviewer 1 request the removal of "short"


> p3, 30: "null arity" -> "arity zero", or "zero-ary"/"nullary"

Fixed to "nullary".


> p4, 13: the empty set is not a congruence relation, the authors
> probably mean the diagonal set { (x, x) | x in T }

PF Fixed

> p5, 20: for functions of arity > 1, congruence edges have to be
> labeled with a vector of equalities

TODO

> p5, 21: "logic" -> "logical"

Fixed.
