Open Tasks:
-----------

* Demonstrate that algorithm works for a small handcrafted proof (Andreas) [Due: 30/03/15]

* Investigate PT before FC-LU (Andreas) [Due: 30/03/15]

* Try to find compressible theory lemmas in Pascal's recent proof. (Georg) [Due: 30/03/15]



Deferred Tasks:
---------------

* Introduction: story-line (Georg) [Originally Due: 24/11/14; Due: 17/12/14]

* mathSAT proofs in VeriT's format (Feasible?) (Georg's Student) [Originally Due: 24/11/14; Due: TBD]

* Read, review and compactify paper (Pascal) [Due: 17/12/14]

* find good journals where the paper could be submitted - Is it good enough for JAR? (Pascal) [Due: 17/12/14]

* n. log(n^2) - Downey-Sehti. (Pascal) [Due: 17/12/14]

* cite the reviewers (Pascal) [Discussed: 29/10/14]

* Source for good benchmarks: Besson, PxTP 2012 http://people.rennes.inria.fr/Frederic.Besson/euf.pdf [Discussed: 29/10/14]

* Testing compressibility by translating to SAT. Is it impractical as in Space compression? [Discussed: 29/10/14]

* Maybe move the basic definitions etc. to a section "Preliminaries". [Discussed: 29/10/14]

* Move basic proofs, definitions and pseudo-codes to appendix. [Discussed: 29/10/14]

* Some proofs (which?) might need a little bit more detailed explanation. [Discussed: 29/10/14]

* The pseudo-code for some of the very simple methods can probably be 
removed. [Discussed: 29/10/14]

* Give more hints toward the intuition behind the more complex methods (which?)  
(troubles to "reverse-engineer" the intuitive meaning of some data structures.) [Discussed: 29/10/14]
