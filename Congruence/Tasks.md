Remaining Tasks:
----------------

* implement parsers for VeriT's new format (Bruno) [Due: 15/01/15]

* implement a variant of Andreas' algorithm that does not generate theory lemma subproofs (Andreas) [Due: 23/01/15]

* re-run experiments without subproofs for theory lemmas (Andreas) [Due: 23/01/15]

* MathSAT proofs in VeriT format without theory subproofs (Georg) [Due: 24/12/15]

* simplify Section 6: f_i, t_i, leftward edges (Pascal) [Due: 6/01/15]

* mathSAT proofs in VeriT's format (Feasible?) (Georg's Student) [Originally Due: 24/11/14; Due: 06/01/15]


Deferred Tasks:
---------------

* sledgehammer min and pascal's incremental approach (Future GSoC student?) [Due: TBD]

* find good journals where the paper could be submitted - Is it good enough for JAR? (Pascal) [Originally Due: 17/12/14]

* cite the reviewers (Pascal) [Discussed: 29/10/14]

* Source for good benchmarks: Besson, PxTP 2012 http://people.rennes.inria.fr/Frederic.Besson/euf.pdf [Discussed: 29/10/14]

* Testing compressibility by translating to SAT. Is it impractical as in Space compression? [Discussed: 29/10/14]

* Maybe move the basic definitions etc. to a section "Preliminaries". [Discussed: 29/10/14]

* Move basic proofs, definitions and pseudo-codes to appendix. [Discussed: 29/10/14]

* Some proofs (which?) might need a little bit more detailed explanation. [Discussed: 29/10/14]

* The pseudo-code for some of the very simple methods can probably be 
removed. [Discussed: 29/10/14]

* Give more hints toward the intuition behind the more complex methods (which?)  
(troubles to "reverse-engineer" the intuitive meaning of some data structures.) [Discussed: 29/10/14]
