Resolution and superposition are common techniques which have seen widespread use with propositional and first-order logic in modern theorem provers. In these cases, resolution proof production is a key feature of such tools; however, the proofs that they produce are not necessarily as concise as possible.
For propositional resolution proofs, there are a wide variety of proof compression techniques. There are fewer techniques for compressing first-order resolution proofs generated by automated theorem provers.
This paper describes an approach to compressing first-order logic proofs based on lifting proof compression ideas used in propositional logic to first-order logic. One method for propositional proof compression is \emph{partial regularization}, which removes an inference $\eta$ when it is redundant in the sense that its pivot literal already occurs as the pivot of another inference located below in the path from $\eta$ to the roof of the proof. 
This paper describes the generalization of the partial-regularization algorithm

from propositional logic to first-order logic. The generalized algorithm performs partial regularization of resolution proofs containing resolution and factoring inferences with \emph{unification}. %The resolution calculus is the underlying proof-theoretical foundation for many automated theorem provers.
