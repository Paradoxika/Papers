%In this section, we describe challenges that have to be overcome in order to successfully adapt {\RPI} to the first-order case.  Our first example illustrates the need to take unification into account. The next example illustrates that unification cannot be handled naively.

%straightforward example
\begin{example}\label{ex:unif} 
Consider the left proof $\psi$ in Figure \ref{ex1joined}. When computed as in the propositional case, the safe literals for $\eta_3$ are $\{ Q(c), ~ P(a,x)\}$.
As neither of $\eta_3$'s resolved literals is syntactically equal to a safe literal, the propositional {\RPI} algorithm would not change $\psi$. However, $\eta_3$'s left resolved literal $P(w,x)\in \eta_1$ is unifiable with the safe literal $P(a,x)$. Regularizing $\eta_3$, by deleting the edge between $\eta_2$ and $\eta_3$ and replacing $\eta_3$ by $\eta_1$, leads to further deletion of $\eta_4$ (because it is not resolvable with $\eta_1$) and finally to the much shorter proof $\psi'$ in Figure \ref{ex1joined}.

%$\eta_1$'s literal is unifiable with $p(a,X)$, which is inherited from $\eta_3$'s safe literals. 
%Thus the proof can be regularized by recycling $\eta_1$.
%$\eta_1$ and $\eta_5$ and these two literals are unifiable. Further, the safe literals for $\eta_1$ includes $\eta_5$. Thus the proof can be regularized by recycling $\eta_1$.

\noindent
Unlike in the propositional case, where a resolved literal must be syntactically equal to a safe literal for regularization to be possible, Example \ref{ex:unif} suggests that, in the first-order case, it might suffice that the resolved literal be unifiable with a safe literal. However, there are cases where mere unifiability is not enough and greater care is needed: e.g., when $\eta_1:~ \vdash P(a,c)$ and $\eta_2: P(a,c) \vdash Q(c)$ in Example \ref{ex:unif}. One way to prevent these cases is to require the resolved literal to be not only unifiable but subsume a safe literal. %A weaker (and better) requirement is possible, and requires a slight modification of the concept of safe literals, taking into account the unifications that occur on the paths from a node to the root. 
A slight modification to the concept of safe literals, which takes into account the unifications that occur on the paths from a node to the root, results in a weaker (and better) requirement.

%\begin{definition}
%\emph{First-order safe literals} for a node $\eta$, denoted $\mathcal{S}(\eta)$, are a set of instantiated resolved literals used as pivots in all paths below $\eta$ in the proof, or that occur in the root clause of the proof.
%\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:safefirst}
The set of \emph{safe literals} for a node $\eta$ in a proof $\psi$ with root clause $\Gamma$, denoted $\mathcal{S}(\eta)$, is such that $\ell \in \mathcal{S}(\eta)$ if and only if $\ell \in \Gamma$ or for all paths from $\eta$ to the root of $\psi$ there is an edge $\n_1
\xrightarrow[\sigma]{\ell'} \n_2$ with $\ell' \sigma = \ell$.
\end{definition}

\noindent
As in the propositional case, safe literals can be computed in a bottom-up traversal of the proof. Initially, at the root, the safe literals are exactly the literals that occur in the root clause. As we go up, the safe literals $\mathcal{S}(\eta')$ of a parent node $\eta'$ of $\eta$ where $\eta'
\xrightarrow[\sigma]{\ell} \eta$ is set to $\mathcal{S}(\eta) \cup \{ \ell \sigma \}$. Note that we apply the substitution to the resolved literal before adding it to the set of safe literals (cf. Algorithm \ref{algo:foSetSafeLiterals}, lines 8 and 10). In other words, in the first-order case, the set of safe literals has to be a set of \emph{instantiated} resolved literals.

%In the case of Example \ref{ex:pairwise}, computing safe literals as defined above would result in $\mathcal{S}(\eta_3)=\{Q(c),~P(a,b)\}$, where clearly the pivot $P(a,c)$ in $\eta_1$ is not safe. A generalization of this requirement is formalized below.
In the modified case of Example \ref{ex:unif}, computing safe literals as in Definition \ref{def:safefirst} would result in $\mathcal{S}(\eta_3)=\{Q(c),~P(a,b)\}$, where clearly the pivot $P(a,c)$ in $\eta_1$ is not safe. A generalization of this requirement, which can be thought of a \emph{necessary} condition, is Definition \ref{prop:pair}.

%\noindent
%Another way to prevent the problem depicted above would be to require the pivot to be not only unifiable but in fact more general than a safe literal. A weaker (and better) requirement is possible, however, as defined below.

%extra check example
\begin{example}\label{ex:unifcheck}


Satisfying the pre-regularizability is not sufficient. Consider the proof $\psi$ in Figure \ref{fig:ex-unifcheck}. After collecting the safe literals, $\mathcal{S}(\eta_3) = \{\lnot Q(r,v),\lnot P(c,d), Q(f(a,e),c)\}$.
%\noindent
$\eta_3$'s pivot $Q(f(a,v),u)$ matches the safe literal $Q(f(a,e),c)$. Attempting to regularize $\eta_3$ would lead to the removal of $\eta_2$, the replacement of $\eta_3$ by $\eta_1$ and the removal of $\eta_4$ (because $\eta_1$ does not contain the pivot required by $\eta_5$), with $\eta_5$ also being replaced by $\eta_1$. Then resolution between $\eta_1$ and $\eta_6$ results in $\eta_7'$, which cannot be resolved with $\eta_8$, as shown below.


\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{prooftree}
\def\e{\mbox{\ $\vdash$\ }}
\AxiomC{$\eta_8$: $Q(f(a,e),c)\e$ \hspace{-0.5cm}}
\AxiomC{$\eta_6$: $\e P(c,d)$}
\AxiomC{$\eta_1$: $P(u,v)\e Q(f(a,v),u)$}
\BinaryInfC{$\eta_7'$: $\e Q(f(a,d),c)$}
\BinaryInfC{$\psi'$: ??}
\end{prooftree}
\end{scriptsize}

\noindent
$\eta_1$'s literal $Q(f(a, v), u)$, which would be resolved with $\eta_8$'s literal, was changed to $Q(f(a,d),c)$ due to the resolution between $\eta_1$ and $\eta_6$.
\end{example}



%ToDo: The following paragraph is not understandable. It must be made clearer. It must be made more formal (as a definition) and more mathematically precise (with the same level of detail as definition 2). It must explain \textbf{why} this additional check suffices.

\noindent
Thus we additionally require that the following condition be satisfied, which ensures that the remainder of the proof does not expect a variable in $\eta_1$ to be unified to different values simultaneously. This property is not necessary in the propositional case, as the literals of the replacement node do not change lower in the proof. 

%\begin{definition} %This is the pre-revision definition

%%without loss generality 
%$\eta_2 \xrightarrow[\sigma_2]{\{\ell_2\} } \eta$ and $\dual{\ell_2}$ is unifiable with some $\ell^* \in \mathcal{S}(\eta)$. 
%%TODO \marginpar{explain, mathematically, what is assumed about $\eta_2$ and $\ell_2$ here}  %Done? This used to say that $\eta_2$ was a deleted node, so that must mean that $\eta_1$ contains the resolved literal that is safe, i.e. $\eta_1$ contains $\ell_1 \in \mathcal{S}(\eta)$, and we have that $\ell_1 = \dual{\ell_2}$
%%is marked as a \texttt{deletedNode}
%%in a proof $\psi$
%The node $\eta$ is said to be \emph{strongly regularizable} in $\psi$ if there exists a substitution $\sigma$ such that $\Gamma_1 \sigma \subseteq \mathcal{S}(\eta)$.

The node $\eta$ is said to be \emph{strongly regularizable} in $\psi$ if $\Gamma_1 \sigma_{1} \sqsubseteq \mathcal{S}(\eta)$.
\end{definition}

%we ensure that the replacement parent is (possibly after unification) contained entirely in the safe literals. 

%In order to avoid these scenarios, we perform an additional check during inference removal. The node $\eta*$ which will replace a resolution $\eta$ (because $\eta$ would have a deleted parent), must be entirely contained, via unification which modifies only $\eta^*$'s variables, in the safe literals of $\eta$. 
%%In this example, $\eta_1$ does not satisfy this property: in order to unify with $\eta_3$'s safe literals, it would be necessary to send $V\rightarrow Z$ due to $\eta_1$'s second literal, but leave $V$ unchanged due $\eta_1$'s first literal, which is not possible. This check is not necessary in the propositional case, as the replacement node would be contained exactly in the set of safe literals, and would not change lower in the proof.
%In this example, $\eta_1$ does not satisfy this property. This check is not necessary in the propositional case, as the replacement node would be contained exactly in the set of safe literals, and would not change lower in the proof.

\noindent
The notion of \emph{strongly regularizable} can be thought of as a \emph{sufficient} condition.
The longer version of this paper (available on the ArXiv \cite{longversion}) discusses a conjectured weaker condition. 
%and the following is proved in \cite{longversion}, which also discusses a conjectured weaker condition. % is also discussed in \cite{longversion}.

%In order to show that this, the usual notion of subsumption is necessary. We will use $X \sqsubseteq Y$ to denote that $X$ \emph{subsumes} $Y$, when there exists a substitution $\sigma$ such that $X\sigma \subseteq Y$.


\begin{thm}\label{thm:correct}
Let $\psi$ be a proof with root clause $\Gamma$ and $\eta$ be a node in $\psi$. Let $\psi^{\dagger} = \psi\setminus \{\eta\}$ and $\Gamma^{\dagger}$ be the root of $\psi^{\dagger}$. If $\eta$ is strongly regularizable, then $\Gamma^{\dagger} \sqsubseteq \Gamma$.
