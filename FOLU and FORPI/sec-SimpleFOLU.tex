\section{A Linear Greedy Variant of First-Order \LowerUnits}
\label{sec:SimpleFOLU}

The {\FOLowerUnits} described in the previous section is not only complex (worst-case quadratic run-time complexity in the length of the input proof) but also difficult to implement. The necessity to ensure the post-deletion unifiability property would require a lot of bookkeeping, to track changes in literals and their descendants, and to know which literals have to be contracted in the bottom of the proof before reintroduction of the units. 

This section presents {\SFOLowerUnits} (Algorithm \ref{algo:optSFOLU}), an alterantive (single traversal) variant of {\FOLowerUnits}, which avoids the quadratic complexity and the implementation difficulties by: 1) ignoring the stricter post-deletion unifiability property and focusing instead on the pre-deletion unifiability property, which is easier to check (lines 9-11); and 2) employing a greedy contraction approach (lines 16-18) together with substitutions (lines 5-7), in order not to care about bookkeeping. By doing so, compression may not always succeed on all proofs (e.g. Example \ref{ex:rootpair}). When compression succeeds, the root clause of the generated proof will be the empty clause (line 20) and the generated proof may be returned. Otherwise, the original proof must be returned (line 20).

% Algorithm \ref{algo:simpleFOLU} works similarly to the propositional algorithm.  It first performs a bottom up traversal to collect units which satisfy Property \ref{prop:pair}, adding those that do to a queue (line 3). It then attempts to re-introduce all the removed units at the bottom of the proof, where it attempts to compress the literals that would be resolved away by each unit (lines 6-15). In order to avoid traversing the proof to find literals resolved away from by each unit again after the deletion of every potential unit (as is done in Algorithm \ref{algo:FOLU}), we use a modified \FuncSty{delete} function, called \FuncSty{simple-fo-delete}, which is the same as Algorithm \ref{algo:del} except with line 6 changed to the following:

%    \lIf{$~\varphi'_L \in D~$}{ 
%      \Return{$(\rho(\varphi'_L) \sigma_R)$} 
%     }
%     \lElseIf{$\varphi'_R \in D$}{ 
%       \Return{$(\rho(\varphi'_R) \sigma_R)$}  
%     }

% \FuncSty{simple-fo-delete} is designed to reduce the complexity of tracking literals. \FuncSty{simple-fo-delete} behaves much more closely to the propositional case and requires none of the additional data structures required by \FuncSty{fo-delete}. In this function, when a unit node is deleted, instead of returning the opposite node (respectively $\psi_L'$ or $\psi_R'$, line 6) in the resolution (which is done in the propositional case), or tracking the literals (which is done in \FuncSty{fo-delete}), we return the opposite node with $\sigma_L$ (respectively $\sigma_R$) applied to its root clause. In this way, the literals not resolved with the unit will look like they would have in the original proof, and the literals which were not resolved due to the deletion looks like it is syntactically equal with the unit literal at this stage. The fact that the other literals look like they did in the original proof is key: now resolution in the compressed proof can use the old literals, which should appear as they before, and not worry about choosing the wrong literal in case of ambiguous resolution. 

% %A negative side-effect of this is that we may end up grounding literals, and having to carry these forms of each literal forward, which may increase the character length of the clause, though not the number of nodes in the proof.

% However, we can not guarantee that Property \ref{prop:rootpair} is satisfied. The appearance of literals that were to be resolved away from a unit clause may have changed, preventing completion of the proof. If this happens {\SFOLowerUnits} will attempt to re-introduce this node and fail, returning the original input proof (line 12). As a result, some proofs that can be compressed are returned unmodified, but those that do not require this additional property can be compressed much more quickly.

% Alternatively, if additional unifiers do not modify the literals resolved away by a unit, those literals will still satisfy Property \ref{prop:pair}, and any contraction that reduces the length by as much as possible, such as one found in line 7, will reduce these literals to a single literal, which will be unifiable with the unit.
